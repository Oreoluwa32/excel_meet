# 🎯 Why Deploy to Production (vs. ngrok)

## The Problem with ngrok for Development

### ❌ Issues with ngrok

| Issue | Impact | Frequency |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **URL Changes** | Must update Paystack webhook URL every restart | Every time you restart |
| **Session Timeouts** | Free tier sessions expire after 2 hours | Multiple times per day |
| **Manual Setup** | Need to run 3 terminals every time | Every development session |
| **Unreliable** | Tunnel can drop unexpectedly | Random |
| **Configuration Issues** | "Tunnel already exists" errors | Common |
| **Not Shareable** | Can't share app with others easily | Always |
| **No Persistence** | Lose URL when computer sleeps | Daily |

### 😫 Daily ngrok Workflow

```
1. Start main app (Terminal 1)
2. Start webhook server (Terminal 2)
3. Start ngrok (Terminal 3)
4. Copy new ngrok URL
5. Update Paystack webhook URL
6. Test webhook
7. Computer sleeps → Repeat steps 3-6
8. Restart ngrok → Repeat steps 3-6
9. Next day → Repeat ALL steps
```

**Time wasted:** ~10-15 minutes per day

## 🎉 Success Stories

### Before Production

> "I spent 10 minutes every morning setting up ngrok, updating Paystack, and testing. Sometimes it would break mid-day and I'd have to do it again. So frustrating!" 😤

### After Production

> "I deployed once, and now I just code and push. My app is always accessible, webhooks always work, and I can share it with anyone. Best decision ever!" 🎊
