# Jobs Feature Update

## Overview
This update enables real-time job posting and viewing functionality on the home page. Jobs are now stored in and fetched from the Supabase database, with real-time updates when new jobs are posted.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Job Service (`src/utils/jobService.js`)
Created a comprehensive service for managing job operations:
- **fetchJobs()** - Fetch jobs with filters and pagination
- **fetchJobById()** - Get a single job by ID
- **createJob()** - Create a new job posting
- **updateJob()** - Update an existing job
- **deleteJob()** - Delete a job
- **fetchUserJobs()** - Get all jobs posted by a user
- **subscribeToJobs()** - Real-time subscription to job updates
- **searchJobs()** - Search jobs by keyword
- **getJobStats()** - Get job statistics

### 2. Updated JobFeed Component (`src/pages/home-dashboard/components/JobFeed.jsx`)
- Replaced mock data with real Supabase queries
- Added real-time subscription for instant updates when jobs are posted
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states
- Added data transformation to match the expected format
- Improved empty state messages based on filter status

### 3. Updated Home Dashboard (`src/pages/home-dashboard/index.jsx`)
- Integrated job service for creating jobs
- Removed page reload after job creation (now uses real-time updates)
- Added refresh trigger mechanism
- Fixed prop passing to JobFeed component

## Features

### Real-Time Updates
When a user posts a new job:
1. The job is saved to the Supabase database
2. All connected clients receive a real-time notification
3. The job feed automatically refreshes to show the new job
4. No page reload required

### Filtering
Jobs can be filtered by:
- Category (e.g., IT, Healthcare, Construction)
- Urgency (urgent, high, normal, low)
- Location (state and city)

### Pagination
- Jobs are loaded in batches of 10
- "Load More" button appears when more jobs are available
- Smooth loading states with skeleton screens

### Error Handling
- Graceful error messages if database connection fails
- Retry button for failed requests
- Fallback to empty state with helpful messages

## Database Schema

The jobs table includes:
- Basic info: title, category, description
- Budget: min/max amounts, budget type (fixed/hourly)
- Location: state, city, address
- Timing: start date, duration, urgency
- Skills: required skills array
- Status: open, in_progress, completed, cancelled
- Metadata: created_at, updated_at

## Row Level Security (RLS)

The following policies are in place:
- Anyone can view open jobs
- Authenticated users can create jobs
- Users can update/delete their own jobs
- Admins can manage all jobs
