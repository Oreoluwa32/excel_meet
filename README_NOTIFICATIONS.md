## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Notifications

When a user performs an action (like applying to a job), a database trigger automatically creates a notification for the relevant user. This notification is then broadcast in real-time to all connected clients.

**Example Flow:**
1. User B applies to User A's job
2. Database trigger fires automatically
3. Notification created for User A
4. Supabase broadcasts via WebSocket
5. User A's browser receives notification instantly
6. Bell badge updates, dropdown shows notification
7. Browser notification appears (if permitted)

**No manual notification creation needed!**

## 📊 Notification Types

| Type | When It Happens | Who Gets Notified |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Application Submitted | Someone applies to a job | Job Poster |
| Application Accepted | Job poster accepts application | Applicant |
| Application Rejected | Job poster rejects application | Applicant |
| Application Withdrawn | Applicant withdraws | Job Poster |
| Job Updated | Job details change | All Applicants |
| Job Deleted | Job is removed | All Applicants |

---

## 🔐 Security

All notifications are secured with Row Level Security (RLS):

- ✅ Users can only see their own notifications
- ✅ Users can only modify their own notifications
- ✅ Database triggers run with elevated permissions
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions are filtered by user_id

---

## 🎨 UI Components

### Notification Bell (Header)

- Shows unread count badge
- Click to open dropdown
- Quick actions available

### Notifications Page

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenario 1: New Application
1. Login as Job Poster (User A)
2. Post a job
3. Login as Professional (User B) in another window
4. Apply to the job
5. Check User A's notifications - should see "New Application Received!"

### Test Scenario 2: Accept Application
1. User A accepts the application
2. Check User B's notifications - should see "Application Accepted! 🎉"
3. Both notifications should appear instantly without refresh

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Notifications not appearing?
1. Check Realtime is enabled in Supabase
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify user is authenticated

### Unread count not updating?
1. Check real-time subscription is active
2. Look for "New notification received" in console
3. Verify triggers are working in database

### Browser notifications not showing?
1. Grant notification permission when prompted
2. Check browser settings allow notifications
3. Test with `Notification.requestPermission()`
