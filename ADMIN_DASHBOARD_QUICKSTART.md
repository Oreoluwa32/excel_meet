## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

**Cause**: User doesn't have admin role
**Solution**: 
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Issue: Statistics showing zero or not loading
**Cause**: Migration not applied or no data in database
**Solution**: 
1. Verify migration was run successfully
2. Check that tables exist in Supabase
3. Add some test data (users, jobs, etc.)

### Issue: Can't submit support tickets
**Cause**: RLS policies not applied or user not authenticated
**Solution**: 
1. Verify migration was run (includes RLS policies)
2. Ensure user is logged in
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Ticket responses not showing
**Cause**: Ticket responses table not created or RLS issue
**Solution**: 
1. Verify `ticket_responses` table exists
2. Check RLS policies are enabled
3. Refresh the ticket detail modal

### Issue: "Column reference 'date' is ambiguous" error
**Cause**: Old version of migration file
**Solution**: The migration file has been updated. Re-run the migration.

## üìä Sample Data for Testing

If you want to populate the database with test data:

```sql

  ((SELECT id FROM user_profiles LIMIT 1), 
   'App is slow', 
   'The application takes too long to load pages', 
   'complaint', 
   'high', 
   'open'),
  ((SELECT id FROM user_profiles LIMIT 1), 
   'Add dark mode', 
   'Please add a dark mode option to the app', 
   'feature_request', 
   'medium', 
   'open'),
  ((SELECT id FROM user_profiles LIMIT 1), 
   'Cannot upload resume', 
   'Getting an error when trying to upload my resume', 
   'bug', 
   'urgent', 
   'in_progress');

-- Create test system logs
INSERT INTO system_logs (log_level, message, source)
VALUES 
  ('info', 'User logged in successfully', 'auth-service'),
  ('warning', 'High memory usage detected', 'system-monitor'),
