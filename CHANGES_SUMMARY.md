## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Check portfolio images display correctly in view profile
- [ ] Verify service categories display in view profile

## Notes

1. **Storage Bucket Setup**: The portfolios storage bucket needs to be created in Supabase. Run the migration or create it manually in the Supabase dashboard.

2. **Image Optimization**: Consider adding image compression/optimization before upload for better performance.

3. **Error Handling**: All upload operations include proper error handling with user-friendly messages.

4. **Security**: File type and size validation is performed on the client side. Consider adding server-side validation as well.

5. **Portfolio Data Structure**: Portfolio items are stored as JSON in the database with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "id": timestamp,
     "title": "string",
     "description": "string",
     "image": "url",
     "category": "string"
   }
   ```
