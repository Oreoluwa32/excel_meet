   USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
   WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id)
   ```

3. **Delete Own Notifications:**
   ```sql
   USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
   ```

4. **System Can Create:**
   ```sql
   WITH CHECK (true)  -- Via service role
   ```

5. **Admin Full Access:**
   ```sql
   USING (public.is_admin())
   WITH CHECK (public.is_admin())
   ```
