## 🐛 Common Questions

### "Is it safe to deploy with test keys?"

**Yes!** Paystack test mode is completely safe:

### "What if I break something?"

**Easy to fix!**
- Git keeps all versions
- Vercel/Render have rollback
- Test locally first
- Can redeploy anytime

### "Will it cost money?"

**No!** Free tiers are generous:
- Vercel: 100GB bandwidth/month
- Render: 750 hours/month
- More than enough for testing
- Upgrade only when needed

### "Can I still develop locally?"

**Yes!** Best of both worlds:
- Develop locally as usual
- Push to deploy
- Production always available
- No more ngrok hassle
