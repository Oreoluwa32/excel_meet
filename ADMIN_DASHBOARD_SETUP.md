## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

You need to run the migration to create the necessary tables:

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or apply the migration manually in Supabase Dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor and run the contents of:
# supabase/migrations/20250202000000_create_admin_system.sql
```

### Step 2: Create an Admin User

Update an existing user to have admin role:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

Or use the test admin account created by the initial migration:
- Email: `admin@excel-meet.com`
- Password: `password123`

### Step 3: Access the Admin Dashboard

1. Log in with an admin account
2. Click on your profile in the header
3. Select "Admin Dashboard" from the dropdown
4. Or navigate directly to: `http://localhost:5173/admin-dashboard`

### Step 4: Test Support Tickets

As a regular user:
1. Click the help icon (?) in the header
2. Fill out the support ticket form
3. Submit the ticket

As an admin:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Support tab
2. View the submitted ticket
3. Assign it to yourself
4. Respond to the user
5. Update the status as you work on it
