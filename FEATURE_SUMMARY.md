## 🚀 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations

You need to set up the database tables and storage bucket. Choose one method:

#### Option A: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```powershell
# Make sure you're in the project directory
Set-Location "c:\Users\oreol\Documents\Projects\excel_meet"

# Run migrations
supabase migration up
```

#### Option B: Manual Setup in Supabase Dashboard

1. **Create saved_jobs table:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Copy content from `supabase/migrations/20250117000000_create_saved_jobs_table.sql`
   - Paste and click "Run"

2. **Create storage bucket:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
   - Click "New bucket"
   - Name: `jobs`
   - Make it **Public** ✅
   - Click "Create"
   
3. **Set up storage policies:**
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy content from `supabase/migrations/20250117000001_create_jobs_storage_bucket.sql`
   - Paste and click "Run"

### Step 2: Verify Setup

Run the verification script:
```powershell
node verify-setup.js
```

This will check if:
- ✅ saved_jobs table exists
- ✅ jobs storage bucket exists and is public
- ✅ jobs table is accessible

### Step 3: Test the Features

1. **Test Image Upload:**
   - Login to the app
   - Click "+" to create a job
   - Fill in details
   - Click "Add Images" and select images
   - Submit the job
   - View job details - images should appear

2. **Test Saved Jobs:**
   - Browse jobs on home page
   - Click "View Details" on any job
   - Click bookmark icon (top right)
   - Confirm to view saved jobs
   - Verify job appears in saved jobs list

3. **Test Share:**
   - Open any job details
   - Click share button
   - Verify link is shared or copied

## 🎯 How It Works

### Image Upload Flow
```
1. User creates job → Job saved to database (gets job ID)
2. User selected images → Images uploaded to Storage
3. Image URLs returned → Job record updated with URLs
4. User views job → Images displayed from Storage
```

### Save Job Flow
```
1. User clicks bookmark → Check if user is logged in
2. If logged in → Save to saved_jobs table
3. Show confirmation → Option to view saved jobs
4. Navigate to /saved-jobs → Display all saved jobs
```

### Job Details Flow
```
1. User clicks "View Details" → Navigate with job ID
2. Fetch job data → Get from database using job ID
3. Check if saved → Query saved_jobs table
4. Display job → Show real data with save status
```

## 🔒 Security

- **Storage**: Public read, authenticated write
- **Saved Jobs**: Users can only see/manage their own saved jobs
- **RLS Policies**: Enabled on saved_jobs table
- **File Validation**: Type and size checks on client side

## 📊 Database Schema

### saved_jobs Table
```sql
id          UUID (Primary Key)
user_id     UUID (Foreign Key → auth.users)
job_id      UUID (Foreign Key → jobs)
created_at  TIMESTAMP
UNIQUE(user_id, job_id)
```

### Storage Structure
```
jobs/
  └── job-images/
      ├── {jobId}_0_{timestamp}.jpg
      ├── {jobId}_1_{timestamp}.png
      └── ...
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing
- ✅ Check storage bucket exists and is **public**
- ✅ Verify images were uploaded (check Supabase Storage)
- ✅ Check browser console for errors
- ✅ Ensure images are under 5MB

### Saved Jobs Not Working
- ✅ Check saved_jobs table exists
- ✅ Verify user is logged in
- ✅ Check RLS policies are enabled
- ✅ Look for errors in browser console

### "Bucket not found" Error
- ✅ Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
- ✅ Create bucket named `jobs`
- ✅ Make it **public**
- ✅ Run storage policies SQL
