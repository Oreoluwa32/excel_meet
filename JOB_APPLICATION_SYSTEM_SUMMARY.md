## üöÄ How to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Run the Migration
You need to manually run the migration in Supabase SQL Editor:

1. **Open the migration file**:
   - File: `supabase/migrations/20250122000000_create_job_applications_table.sql`
   - Select all content (Ctrl+A)
   - Copy (Ctrl+C)

2. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to your project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
   - Click **New Query**

3. **Paste and Run**:
   - Paste the migration SQL (Ctrl+V)
   - Click **Run** button
   - Wait for success message

4. **Verify**:
   - Go to **Table Editor**
   - You should see `job_applications` table
   - Check that it has columns: id, job_id, applicant_id, proposal, status, created_at, updated_at

---

### Step 2: Test the Feature

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test as Professional (Applicant)**:
   - Login as a professional user
   - Navigate to a job details page
   - Click "Accept Job" button
   - Enter a proposal in the modal
   - Submit the proposal
   - Button should change to "Proposal Submitted"
   - Try clicking again - should be disabled

3. **Test as Job Poster**:
   - Login as the user who posted the job
   - Navigate to the job details page
   - Click "View Applications" button
   - You should see all applications with applicant details
   - Click "Accept" or "Reject" to update status
   - Status badge should update immediately

4. **Test Duplicate Prevention**:
   - As a professional, try to apply to the same job twice
