- Try different browsers

### 2. Test Different Scenarios
- Slow 3G connection
- Offline mode

- Different screen sizes

### 3. Monitor Console
Always keep DevTools console open:

"[Service Worker] Installing..."
"[Service Worker] Activated"
```

```javascript
// In browser console:
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
  registrations.forEach(registration => registration.unregister());
});
```
