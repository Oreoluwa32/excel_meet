## 🔍 How It Works

### **The Magic: Database Triggers**

When an admin responds to a ticket:

1. **Admin clicks "Send Response"**
2. **Response saved to `ticket_responses` table**
3. **Database trigger fires automatically**
4. **Trigger creates notification in `notifications` table**
5. **User sees notification in bell icon**
6. **User clicks → redirected to ticket**

**No manual code needed!** The database handles everything.
