## 🔧 Technical Details

### New Functions in jobService.js
```javascript
uploadJobImages(images, jobId)      // Upload images to storage
saveJob(userId, jobId)              // Save a job
unsaveJob(userId, jobId)            // Unsave a job
isJobSaved(userId, jobId)           // Check if job is saved
fetchSavedJobs(userId)              // Get all saved jobs
```

### Database Schema

**saved_jobs table:**
```sql
id          UUID PRIMARY KEY
user_id     UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
job_id      UUID REFERENCES jobs(id)
created_at  TIMESTAMP
UNIQUE(user_id, job_id)
```

**Storage structure:**
```
jobs/
  └── job-images/
      ├── {jobId}_0_{timestamp}.jpg
      ├── {jobId}_1_{timestamp}.png
      └── ...
```

### Security
- ✅ RLS enabled on saved_jobs table
- ✅ Storage bucket with proper policies
- ✅ Users can only manage their own saved jobs
- ✅ Public read access for images
- ✅ Authenticated write access for images

## 🎯 User Flows

### Image Upload Flow
```
User creates job → Job saved to DB (gets ID)
                ↓
User selected images → Upload to Storage
                ↓
Get image URLs → Update job record
                ↓
User views job → Images displayed
```

### Save Job Flow
```
User views job → Click bookmark icon
              ↓
Check if logged in → Save to saved_jobs table
              ↓
Show confirmation → Option to view saved jobs
              ↓
Navigate to /saved-jobs → Display all saved jobs
```

### Share Job Flow
```
User views job → Click share icon
              ↓
Mobile device? → Native share menu
              ↓
Desktop? → Copy link to clipboard
              ↓
Share with anyone → They can view the job
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create job with images
- [ ] View job details with images
- [ ] Save a job
- [ ] View saved jobs page
- [ ] Unsave a job
- [ ] Share a job
- [ ] View shared job link
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Test with slow network
- [ ] Test error states

### Automated Verification
```powershell
node verify-setup.js
```

This checks:
- ✅ saved_jobs table exists
- ✅ jobs storage bucket exists
- ✅ Storage bucket is public
- ✅ jobs table is accessible

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Bucket not found"**
- Solution: Create `jobs` bucket in Supabase Storage
- Make sure it's set to **public**

**Images not showing**
- Check if bucket is public
- Verify storage policies are set
- Check browser console for errors

**Can't save jobs**
- Ensure saved_jobs table exists
- Check if user is logged in
- Verify RLS policies are enabled

**"Permission denied"**
- Run storage policies SQL again
- Check RLS policies on saved_jobs table

### Debug Commands
```powershell
# Verify setup
node verify-setup.js

# Check Supabase connection
# (Open browser console and check for errors)

# View migration files

- ✅ File size limits
- ✅ Authentication checks
- ✅ User-specific data isolation

### Security Best Practices
- Images are publicly readable (by design)
- Users can only manage their own saved jobs
- Storage policies prevent unauthorized uploads
- RLS ensures data privacy
- Input validation on client and server
